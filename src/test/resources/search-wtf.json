Doesn’t do that on my machine.  Better look at the log”\r\n- Dev looks at the log and sees the exception was a divide by zero error.\r\nDev: “Ohhh…yea…the average price calculation, it’s a bug in the database.”\r\n<I burst out laughing> \r\nMe: “That’s funny.”\r\n<Dev manager was not laughing>\r\nDevMgr: “What’s funny about bugs in the database?”\r\nMe: “Divide by zero exceptions are not an indication of a data error, it’s a bug in the code.”\r\nDev: “Uhh…how so?  The price factor is zero, which comes from a table, so that’s a bug in the database”\r\nMe: “Jim, will you have sales with a price factor of zero?”\r\nStakeholderJim: “Yea, for add-on items that we’re not putting on sale.  Hats, gloves, things like that.”\r\nDev: “Steve, did anyone tell you the factor could be zero?”\r\nDBA-Steve: “Uh...no…just that the value couldn’t be null.  You guys can put whatever you want.”\r\nDevMgr: “So, how will you fix this bug?”\r\nDBA-Steve: “Bug? …oh…um…I guess I could default the value to 1.”\r\nDev: “What if the user types in a zero?  Can you switch it to a 1?”\r\nMe: “Or you check the factor value before you try to divide.  That will fix the exception and Steve won’t have to do anything.”\r\n<awkward couple of seconds of silence>\r\nDevMgr: “Lets wrap this up.  Steve, go ahead and make the necessary database changes to make sure the factor is never zero.”\r\nStakeholderJim: “That doesn’t sound right.  Add-on items should never have a factor.  A value of 1 could screw up the average.”\r\nDev: “Don’t worry, we’ll know the difference.”\r\n<everyone seems happy and leaves the meeting>\n\nI completely lost any sort of brain power to say anything after Dev said that.  All the little voices kept saying were ‘WTF?  WTF just happened?  No really…W  T   F   just happened!?’ over and over.  I still have no idea on how to articulate to anyone with any sort of sense about what happened.  Thanks DevRant for letting me rant.",

I told him \"sure why not\" and since we're friends i didn't want him to pay me any money.\n\nHe told me what his thoughts about the design were and i told him that i needed the menu, some decent pictures of the restaurant, the \"about us\" story and the credentials to the server. \n\nHe didn't know the credentials to his server and i told him to ask the person, who made that page to send me the information i needed, but he kept on saying \"could you call her because blah blah\". Well, i did but she couldn't give me that info without asking the owner. So i met him and told him \"hey i told you so, because it's completely normal not give sensible information to unknown people and besides that she told me to tell you that you should give her a call, because she hasn't got your new phone number\". Two months later i got an email with the credentials, but still no menu and no pictures.\n\nFour days ago i made a transition page,  because i didn't want to publish the page with stock images and without menu, so i wrote him again whether he wanted design #1 or #2. Got a text at ~21:00 saying \"design 2, but you need to publish it at 22:00\".\n\nI mean wtf?! He assured me he would call some people he knows to get those things. I told him, that it would be free, because of our friendship, but no support from him and he keeps stressing?! He knows i've got a full-time job and my studies going on, so my time is really limited and he keeps fking around like that?! Man it pisses me really off...",

Sure, Java is difficult, especially as an introductory language, but fuck me, replace it with ANYTHING OTHER THAN JAVASCRIPT PLEASE. JavaScript is not a good language to learn from - it is cheaty and makes script kiddies, not programmers. Fuck, they went from a strong-typed, verbose language to a shit show where you can turn an integer into a function without so much as a peep from the interpreter.\n\nAnd fUCK ME WHY NOT PYTHON?? It's a weak typed but dynamic language that FORCES good indentation and actually has ACCESS TO THE FILE SYSTEM instead of just the web APIs that don't let you do SHIT compared to what you SHOULD learn.\n\nOH AND TO PUT THE ICING ON THE CAKE, the article was comparing hello worlds, and they did the whole Java thing right but used ALERT instead of CONSOLE.LOG for JavaScript??? Sure, you can communicate with the user that way too but if you're comparing the languages, write text to the console in both languages, don't write text to the console in Java and use the alert api in JavaScript.\n\nFuck you Stanford, I expected better you shitty cockmunchers.",

I got stuck when i finally had the loops running but couldn't find a way to format the output without overwriting the existing values on each iteration.\n\nFor the last one week I've been showing the progress on my code to the CTO and this is how it has been.\n\nMe: Hello. Everything is coming along fine, I have most of the functions running properly, do you mind looking into the algorithm?\n\nCTO: Oh not at all, let's see what you got. Omg great code for an intern. I think you should add a new variable there and maybe clean up that function over there because it's deprecated now and yeah HaHa, Great work.\n\nMe: Thanks xD I'll have it finished latest next week. \n\nCTO: Oh great. I can't wait to see what you'd have by next week so we can install it on our WordPress.\n\n*Next finally week comes and I'm done with the code. \n\nMe: Hello, I'm done with the entire code! Want to take a look? The plugin works just exactly as described. \n\n*CTO takes a look \n\nCTO: Omg?\n\nMe: Omg?  \n\nCTO: This is completely bad programming practice, so you are running 4 nested loops that all send queries to our data base and make changes to data. This would have a very drastic effect on the server considering the traffic we get. \n\nMe: But you saw this exact code last week and said it was okay, I only changed some CSS since the last time.\n\nCTO: Omg, we can't accept this, you have to develop it again from the scratch without using those loops and queries.\n\nMe: What? Okay, fine. Any hints?\n\nCTO: Yes.\n\nMe: What? \n\nCTO: Just start. That's the greatest hint I could ever give. And also, always have a plan before you begin. \n\nMe: Yeah, thanks for those. It's the first time I'm hearing them and they would totally be applicable to building this thing.",

Also, English isn't my native language so there will be some words or phrases that I'll probably write wrong... Sorry for that, if there are any corrections, I'll be glad to hear them)\n\nSo...\n\nThere will be an implementation of new \"control point\" on the \"shipping department\" which consists on a electromechanical equipment controlled by a PLC. And despite the original concept was a collaboration between 2 departments (we, IT, and Production Control), I was never taken in consideration about anything of the project... To be fair, I forget about its existence until two weeks ago.\n\nSo, a few days I learned that there are a huge delay regarding the original deadline (mainly because the supplier was delayed with the delivery of their system), and since two weeks (less, actually, because some holydays in between) I'm learning how to integrate that \"P.o.S\" into an existing application on a PC using a serial communication (not the main problem, as I've done that before... With another brand of PLC's) while avoiding buying any additional software (to get the communication done and in a easy way) and that sort of things... But discovering in the process that it will be necessary to acquire such additional SW in order to finish the job ASAP.\n\nWhen suddenly I get the \"news\" that it's almost all my duty (and responsibility) to meet the original deadline, because it doesn't matter how the other departments screw all the schedule, it's the job of IT to get the shit done in time... And what is worst: they didn't said that in such straight manner, no, the implied it while making a quick test with the general manager.\n\nI mean, WTF? Besides doing a \"respectable\" number of \"user support\" activities in a dialy basis, I also need to manage the activities of other departments? And also fix their screw ups on a schedule that I just learned days before?\n\nAnd also there is a coworker (one of whom screwed up) that, almost every time she see me, is asking \"how much until you'll finish?\"\n\nAs I read on a meme years ago: \"please, give patience, because if you give strength, I'll need bail money too...\"\n\nDamn...

First thought: sure why not? Boss says: it has to be done in less than 100 hours of work (an estimate done by my boss and the intern). Me: I can't tell you that before I have seen the code and what functionality has to be in the extension. Boss: Cool, look it over this weekend and tell me if you want to do it or not. \nI looked it through and my answer will probably be: NO WHERE IN HELL am I gonna are this in less that 100 hours! 1. no tests has been performed so I have absolutely no clue if his code works. \n2. variable names are mostly: $string_query (whatever that means?), $result, $string_temp and so on. \n3. Methods and functions are more than 250 lines long, with shitty formatting, and more comments than code. WTF? \n4. The estimate has been made by an intern and my boss  (doesn't know much about programming). I haven't been consulted about it....\n5. No version control. No branches, no commits other than initial commit. Great. \n6. Most comments in the code just tells me what I can read from the code. What it returns and what it takes as params. Can I please know wtf your method call named $booking->run () does? I still haven't found this method in the code after 1 hour of intensively looking for it...\n\nFFS man... Not gonna do this, even though I thought it would have been an interesting project initially.\n\nSorry for the long rant... I just wish the intern would have consulted me about all this shit, since he obviously have bad practices. *sigh*",

All these pages are manually migrated from the old website, which doesn't have a database. Current status: 650 pages/1000 are completed, 40 different templates need to be adapted. I'm alone on these templates, my colleagues create the pages and fill the new database \n\nSo I'm working on the templates a WebDev coded for our website on a licensed CMS, and had this decently simple html block that looks like a square and consisting of roughly this (Emmet style): \n\na.area > blockquote > strong.title + p \n\nAfter adding another <a> element inside the p, I noticed that my <a> wouldn't display and bust the whole look of the square. \n\nJust for more details, the CSS the dev made is ultra specified (meaning each element is too precisely \"described\" : div.class .child .child2 { /* styles */ } when it could be .class .child2 for example). Also, the templates he made need to be compatible with any \"module\" the website has, thus the need of this high specificity\n\nSo I fired up the DevTools to check what happened, and had: \n\nExpected: a.area > blockquote > strong.title + p > a\nActual result: some new a.area were wrapping the <strong>, the <p> and the <a> I just added. The source code was not showing any of this but just the rules I initially wrote - the expected result\n\nWtf?! I thought the JS the dev made was adding elements. I disabled said JS, and bam, these a.area were still wrapping everything!! What black magic would add these stupid tags I never asked for.\n\nSo I went looking in the CSS files in case some wizardry was happening, but everything was OK.\n\nI tried changing my structure, changing tag (swapping a.area to p.area or without .area), HTML just said \"nope, have those please\".\n\nEventually I rewrote my own module out of frustration after three quarters of an hour fiddling with this stupid \"module\". I hate losing time for such shenanigans and under a lot of pressure because of deadlines. \n\nStill haven't figured why those <element>.area would wrap everything out of nowhere...",
