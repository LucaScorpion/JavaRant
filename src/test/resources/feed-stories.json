I'm currently experimenting with three.js and babylon.js and it's so much fun. I love particle effects and 3D animations. Even 2D rendering is damn cool!\n\nI also just learned you can import models from Blender. I never liked Blender's UI, because it seems so bloated and complicated to me. But then again, Blender is amazingly powerful and free, so there is no real reason to complain. I guess I have to learn it know, in order to use WebGL for most of the things I'm envisioning right now.\n\nJust thinking about the amazing possibilities makes my head spin in excitement: interactive 3D infographics, futuristic UIs, games, movies and galleries, â€¦ so. fucking. cool.
