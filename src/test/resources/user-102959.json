Every time I am mentioned in a rant related to it people also mention the idea of a similar application but for in the terminal. So I intend to build that tomorrow.\n\nTo build the best thing for you I want to ask you some questions:\n\n- What operating system are you running?\n\n- Why (or how) would you like to use a devrant terminal reader?\n\n- Why would you NOT want to use a devrant terminal reader?\n\n- Would your use-case required obfuscated output? (Hiding it from someone)\n\n- If so, what formats do you use on a daily basis or are you most comfortable with?\n\n- Anything else you would like to mention or for me to consider?\n\nI will be developing the larger part of this tomorrow, but the sources will be made available to the public.",
